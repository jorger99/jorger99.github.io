Since the beginning of my physics career, I have always been passionate in pursuing physics research. After completing my bachelors in Physics at University of Maryland, College Park, I found myself at the University of Colorado, Boulder, working towards a PhD in experimental quantum research with the National Institute for Standards & Technology (NIST) under the U.S. Department of Commerce.

My current work at NIST involves working with superconducting qubits- specifically the transmon qubit. I'm currently focusing on developing qubit characterization methodologies, CPW resonator analysis, dilution fridge operation, and the other hundreds of skills necessary for a PhD in experimental quantum physics. In the near future I hope to work on single flux quantum control of qubits as one of my main PhD topics.

As a minority in Physics, I have extensively been involved in outreach and DEI efforts, and I am grateful to be at a physics department that values these effort.
